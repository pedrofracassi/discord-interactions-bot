# Discord Interactions Bot

This is a very simple bot made to work with Discord's new interactions API. It has a simple command handler and not much else. **Have fun!**

## Try it on repl.it

I've set this repository up to be easy to try out on repl.it. Just create a `.env` file with the variables below, set the endpoint on the discord developer portal and start hacking!
